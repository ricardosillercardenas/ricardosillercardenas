# Ricardo Siller Cardenas

With 15 years of experience in Account Management, Business Development and Consulting, including roles in Europe, I have developed a deep expertise in these fields. I am particularly passionate about Business Intelligence and Data Analytics, and I have undertaken self-directed learning in coding languages to enhance my skills. I am dedicated to continuous improvement in my professional journey.
